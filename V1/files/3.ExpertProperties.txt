=======================================
This game. Everyone is in the matrix. Mooners, demoers, nhaars, glaciers, bmers, 1v1ers, I want to beat them, all of them. Not just one. I dont just want to be a 1v1er, or a mooner, or a doser, etc. It's a way to play to have everyone lose, or to win should I say, every game. Every single game. They will have to adopt our method to win. That would be the only way.
