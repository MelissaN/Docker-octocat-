People who got the speech

Forcing the mto think abuot something they dont have a basic understanding of
Doesnt want them to skip the urge to get better

too many things at once
	- balanced diet 
we couldnt do it at this size
	- teachers 
we would teach them wrong, would be learning with them
	- experimenting with them
	- they ought to develop experimentation skills, which exercise their creativity
	- Learning new concepts is better than being starved of them.
	- When we do feel we've perfected something, we can update them. 
i dont want it to leak outside the guild - someone else takes credit 
	- We don't need the rightful credit 
		- We're not being sponsored by any investors
		- We want to see our changes sprouting in other patches of the RF community
	- Securing our credit is worth less than the time wasted not spreading good ideas throughout our guild.  
		- Because we don't need credit to thrive
		- But we do need a guild full of rich concepts to thrive

Get everyone settled into their clans. 
Settle the clan rules
"You can have all the freedom you need and want after"

dont like seeing leaders question what they say
I dont want you to be seen as equal
