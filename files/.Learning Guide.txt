Learning Guide

It's not an enormous amount of content, if your focus stays tight throughout.
The goal is to understand how this content fits together fundamentally, which takes meditation, returning to it, and scouring the internet.

I'm going to enjoy this.

Tuesday
	Control Flow , Data Structures
	Can work on blockchain front end instead of rehersing

	I want extra reading today.



What all happened today? 
	Stressed because didn't read.
	Didn't read because blockchain meeting + no food.
	Tomorrow will be early, timed, and long. 
	Because there's no meeting, plenty of food, and I work best in sprints. 
	I want to keep my April score high, to ward off their skepticism and cruelty.
	I want to strengthen my knowledge, so that I can live forever. (Say this for 5 years = 29) 
						I need a plan rather than mere hope. 
	
Tuesday
	Woke up late
		About to start exercises
			Finish early and begin reading
	Finished Exercises, I felt better today then I did after seeing my crush. 3:30pm
	Finished Exercises, Slacking, now Medidating by 5:40pm
		Everyone was happy.
			Naomi adorned me with decorations.
			Sidney agreed with me.
			Miranda thumbs upped me.
		Then I opposed Ju.
			Started with me responding to him.
			I checkedmarked him.
			Then I responded to him or he responded to me.
			Didn't look like he was mad at me. Although I lost all my wealth. 
			I want it to seem like we're both smarter than everyone else. 
				If I hadn't, everyone would have been happy asf. 
				Now I'm just creeped out by everyone's survival instincts.
			Support from Naomi became obscured. It was hot.
				People consider those situations important.
					That's why you gotta help people.
						By staying safe.
							At this point, don't say anything.
 
		If you have energy, a free spirit, and good reputation, then problems like this are easier. 
	All I have to do is create the twister, and then the leaders can administer it. 
	Characters I interacted with will know me. 
		That's the occoms razor route for now. It's safe, I don't lose anything and I gain a ton. 


Questions:
	Why does % negative not work
	Cal slice between two negative indices
	1-2-3 - intro
	4 - flow control
	5 - data structures 
	What is a module?
		How does it differ from a script?


Binge:
	How to stop bingeful urges from distracting me from my agendas?
	When should a binge begin?
	How long should a binge last?
	Can any of this be logically calculated?
		And how sound is the logical foundation of such calculations? 
	What's the purpose of a binge in the first place?


PLD Wednesday:
	Get as much genuine social capital as you can
		One of the few times I get in-person access to people
	Enjoy yourself as much as possible
		Best way to make other people feel good
		You feel best when you cater to others (false)
		You feel best when people think you're cool (true)
		People think you're cool when you feel cool (true)
		You feel cool when you're ahead of your responsibilities (true)
			I'm not ahead so how can I feel cool?
				Readings + Blockchain Issuer 
			Amassing genuine love is one of my responsibilities
				Because I need love
					Feeling good is my responsibility
						Staying ahead is my responsibility
	Enjoy your reputation - Type of binge time
		Maybe I'll restrain binging to PLD days 
			Gotta binge early, so I can wake up early
				Leave around 5pm
	Weak sauce entertainment
	Weak sauce topical bullsht
	Joking Around
		Generic body language responses 


	Don't actively respond to the CEO

	Could read during lunch - can't forget lunch
	Go home and binge at 5pm

Thursday
	Woke up late - because of insigtful morning daydreams
	Decided to discard insightful morning daydreams
		Can obtain more value in the real world without these daydreams
	Finished work, begin reading
	Deciding to put character in storage during learning intervals
		less commentary
		less helping 
		level 3 and below moral intelligence ususally
	

Mental Learning Techniques:
	Comparisons
		comparing one concept to another increases comprehension and memory
	Categorization 
		sorting concepts into categories increases comprehension and memory 
	Subconcious Comprehension
		making every understanding explicit costs too much time, focus, and thus momentum and gains
	Development Process
		Time Frames 
		Foundations 
		Maintanence
		Development

	Development, Maintanence, Foundations, Time Frames 

	Development is when each advancment helps the next advancement.
	
	To develop over 5 years, implies having developed over 4 years,
	and over 3 years
	and over 1 year 
	and each month
	and each day 

	Advancements may be mental, happening in one hour as you lay at the beach. 
	

	Maintanence, Foundations, Time Frames 

	Maintanence

	Maintainance means going back to your project.
	A project won't develop, if its development is discontinued. 

	When you maintain a developmental path, you develop a developmental path.
	To develop over 5 years, means to maintain a developmental path for over 5 years. 
	In that case, Maintanence is everything that's apart of that plan.

	Foundations, Time Frames
	
	Foundations are the developmental path.
		Knowledge.
		Concepts.
		Practice and intuition.
		Succeeding.
			Practicing and studying succeeding.

	Time Frames  
		Development can be broken down into time frames,
		because development is defined as one advancement developing the next.

		<list months> Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec

		<list days vertical> Sun Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat 
		
		developmental path
		developmental plans

	Maintenance of Developmental Path
		over Time Frames
		you shouldn't invest too much time into one thought
			discard

Goals:
	My ultimate goal is probably to become more able to build various forms of software.
	Pleasure Doses
	Mind Type
	Environment
