Things to fix:
	code refactoring / cleaning
	start as a human not an alien (check)
	full screen interface
	boarder so you can't walk off screen
		character needs to know canvas dimentions
			canvas probably shouldn't be resizable
	autoscrolling
	can see humans before they start moving
		keep character and files as models in backend
	
	make it less laggy

Things to experiment with:
	Move model from frontend to backend
		Character Data, Maps, Files
		So front end draws characters that are in the same room

Things to do:
